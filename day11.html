Situated in the inner inlet of Wakasa Bay, Obama flourished as a port connecting Japan to Korea and China in the old days. It used to have strong ties to the ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara. We visit Myotsuji Temple to see a stunning garden, the main hall, and the three-story pagoda designated as national treasures. Then, we bike through idyllic rice paddies, along Wakasa Bay, and onto narrow alleys in Obama's old town quarters. (Breakfast and dinner included)">

                <h3>...</h3>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day11\strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We headed straight to the train station this morning, to head to Obama. We got back on the Thunderbird to Tsuruga Station, where we had to change to a local train.</p>
                <p>We had about an hour before the next train, so left our bags on the platform with our guides (so they could reserve us seats when the train arrived) and went for a wander. I got my eki-stamp then, ourside the station were some mascots for the coastguard, police and fire department, so we got a photo with them! We headed across the road to a convenience store to get some snacks, and there was another pop group singing in the street so we stopped to watch a couple of songs. We were handed a leaflet, and they were a local crafts idol group, who travel the area raising awareness of traditional crafts - on the poster, one of them was holding a blacksmithing hammer!</p>
                <p>We got back to the station early and helped the tour guides get all the bags onto the train, then finished our journey to Obama. It was a, tiny, unmanned station, so no eki stamp sadly! After getting changed in the station toilets, we began our cycling for the day - as it was a loop, we were offered the chance to just go to the hotel as the weather looked a bit dicey, but everyone chose to cycle.</p>
                <p>We didn't get much rain, but the wind was pretty horrendous - it was only a 5km ride to Myotsu-ji temple, but the wind made it feel like going up a massive hill and we were pretty tired by the time we made it!</p>
                <p>The temple was pretty, and there weren't many people around. We got a talk from a monk in the main building (translated by Akira) who explained a bit of the history and the meaning of the different Buddha statues. We then got to walk around and get a good look for ourselves. Outside was a big pagoda with a lightening rod attached.</p>
                <p>A short journey until lunch now, which was in a local restaurant where we sat on cushions on the floor. Our food took a while to come and, by the time everyone was done, it was nearly 4pm. The wind had calmed down thankfully, so we cycled the remaining 30km and made it to the hotel in time for one last onsen before dinner.</p>
                <p>The hotel had lots of animatronic dinosaurs for some reason, so I got very excited by the t-rex in the lobby! Down the corridor with another room with more dinosaurs, and up on the onsen's floor there was a blow-up dinosaur in the corridor as well! Women got to choose our own yukatas again (men got the basic ones in the room!), and they were lovely colourful ones with proper sleaves that you could store things in.</p>
                <p>We watched the sunset from our room with some tea and sweets, then rushed up to the onsen before dinner. We were the first ones down for dinner, and one of hotel staff said I looked 'kawaii' in my yukata! Every member of our group wore their yukatas this evening which was nice, as it was our last meal together in a traditional hotel.</p>
                <p>Dinner was massive, and we couldn't eat all of it as lunch had been so late. They kept bringing out course after course, and the whole meal took two hours! We knew by now that rice and miso soup would be the last course, so kept being shocked when more non-rice appeared. It was delicious, and even the rice was fancy today - they made us all individual portions in special cookware (instead of making a big batch then dishing it out), and it had fish and vegetables in it.</p>
                <p>Very very full, we went back to the dinosaur room to take some photos with the polaroid camera that was in there, then went up to bed - our futons had been set out while we were gone.</p>
