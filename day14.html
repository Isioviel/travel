We spend the morning touring some of the city’s historical sites registered with UNESCO as World Cultural Heritage Sites, including Kinkakuji Temple, Nijo Castle, and Kiyomizu-dera temple. The afternoon is your free time – the city has so much to offer, so you will never feel that you have had enough time in this city! (Breakfast included)">

                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Kiyomizu-dera</h3>
                <p>We met Atsushi and Jiru in the hotel lobby at 6am to visit Kiyomizu-dera - it gets very busy later on in the day, so they wanted to take us before breakfast.</p>
                <p>It was stunning, a massive temple complex with various buildings, pagaodas and leafy scenery. There was a waterfall that you could drink from - it had three spouts to give you longevity, success in education, or luck in love. You could only choose one to drink from, so we both chose longevity.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning0.jpg" alt="first temple building"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning1.jpg" alt="view from the big temple building"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning2.jpg" alt="view of the big temple building"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning3.jpg" alt="looking up at the big temple"></div>
                </div>
                <p>After leaving the temple (it was too early for me to get a goshuin sadly!), we walked through some old streets and interrupted a variety of influencer-style photography sessions, before heading back to the hotel for breakfast.</p>
                <p>Breakfast was buffet style, and they had matcha with a whisk, so I had lots of that instead of coffee. There was mixture of Japanese and Western-style food, so we ate more than we needed to try lots of different things.</p>
                <h3>Kinkaku-ji & Nijō Castle</h3>
                <p>After breakfast, we met the group again in the lobby to get a taxi to Kinkaku-ji, to see the Golden Pavillion. During the journey, we were discussing Kabuki theatre with two of the other tour group members, and they told us about a 'beginner's Kabuki' show at the theatre in Gion. It sounded like a better idea even than the one-act tickets we couldn't get in Tokyo, so we booked tickets for Saturday afternoon.</p>
                <p>It was packed full of tour groups, so I can see why we went early to Kiyomizu-dera in the morning! We got a nice view of the pavillion, walked around the lake, and past a tree being grown in the shape of a boat.</p>
                <p>Atsushi took me ahead to get my goshuin, but there wasn't a queue so I ended up waiting for the rest of the group for a while outside the temple complex.</p>
                <p>It was getting extrememly hot by now, and it was still the morning. We passed a traffic warden directing pedestrians, who had fans blowing in his jacket - it was all puffed up and looked very funny (but practical!).</p>
                <p>We taxied again to our final stop on the tour, Nijō castle and gardens.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning4.jpg" alt="Nijo castle"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning5.jpg" alt="golden pavillion"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning6.jpg" alt="water on a rock in the gardens of Kinkaku-ji"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day14\morning7.jpg" alt="pond and trees in the gardens of Nijō castle"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The castle was very cool; we walked on 'nightingale floors', which squeaked with every movement (this is either an accidental quirk of the manufacturing technique, or a purposeful design to detect assassins, nobody knows for sure), and there were mannequins in some of the rooms to show how nobels would have sat relative to the shogun. The rooms had sections of different floor and ceiling heights, and the edging of tatami mats and the decoration of the ceiling indicated the ranks allowed to be in each location. There were also hidden guard rooms at the shogun's side of the room, so he could be quickly defended if necessary.</p>
                <p>We walked around the gardens next, and up some fortifications for a view. It was extremely hot and we were pretty tired by now.</p>
                <p>Once we reached the exit to the gardens, it was time to say goodbye to the tour group. It had been a fantastic week and it was a bit sad to say farewell, but we were also looking forward to setting our own schedule again and getting some lie-ins.</p>
                <h3>Free time</h3>
                <p>It was only lunch time, so we had lots of time left in the day. We wanted to find some aircon to get out of the heat, so we headed to a craft beer pub which was next to another branch of Traveler's Factory, so I could get refills for my stamp notebook (I had plenty of space left for this trip, but wanted extras to bring home).</p>
                <p>On the way to the pub we passed the Shibori Museum, which had a sign outside advertising workshops. It looked cute so, after cooling down with our beers, we bought some rice balls for a quick lunch and headed back - it turned out to be so much fun!</p>
                <p>We were given a choice of scarf designs, and we didn't know what the processes were so just picked the final design we liked best, which was the <em>arashi</em> pattern (meaning 'storm').</p>
                <p>We wrapped a wet silk scarf around a wide tube, then tightly wrapped elastic around it diagonally. We then pushed the scarf and elastic down to the bottom of the tube so it made a tight bundle at the bottom.</p>
                <p>We went into to a tiny room at the back where the dye was kepy by a large sink, and took it in turns to dip our tubes into the hot dye - we had to wiggle it around for about 2.5 minutes, then took it out to rinse it.</p>
                <p>Once they had cooled, we went back into the main room to take the scarfs off the tubes and do the grand reveal - they had pulled down a screen for us to stand in front of, and another member of staff came to help us shake them out and present them, while our workshop guide took photos for us. It was all very cute.</p>
                <p>They took the scarves off us to rinse and dry them while we explored the museum exhibits upstairs.</p>
                <p>The museum itself was fantastic - there were two large shibori artworks (recreations of Hokusai's paintings), and many smaller ones in frames. There was a museum staff member who spoke perfect English and was very informative. He told us that the large works had taken ten people two years to create! In the back was a 'making of' exhibit, showing the Great Wave design at different points during its creation, and near the entrance was a hands-on area showing lots of different shibori techniques (both finished pieces of cloth and clamped in-progress pieces) that we could pick up and look at. The museum guide explained each piece very clearly, and I came out with loads of inspiration to try the techniques at work with my after-school group!</p>
                <p>When we came back down, our scarves had been packaged neatly and propped up on display tressels. All in all it was a lovely experience, and I am surprised that it didn't come up in all of my prior research. I would highly recommend it!</p>

                </div>
                <p>After leaving the museum we weren't up for doing any more touristing, so we went for burgers (not as good as Shogun!), then to Yobidashi Camera by the main train station to buy Zelda and investigate getting Shinkansen tickets (there was a queue so we didn't bother), then walked back to the hotel for an eary night.</p>
