          <div id="planning">
            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Planning the trip</h2>
            <p>I spent months generally flicking through ideas without any real purpose, then proper planning started a couple of months before we went.</p>
            <p>I used <a href="https://wanderlog.com/" target="_blank">Wanderlog</a> to shape the plan. It was great, though it got really laggy once I had hundreds of map pins! You can save locations, then schedule them into daily plans. I threw in everything that I came across, then saw where they were grouped on the map and planned out days from there.</p>
            <p>Then I made lots of sections for e.g. <em>'Tokyo but not slotted in yet'</em>, <em>'tea shops'</em>, <em>'too far away or currently shut'</em>, as well as the daily itineraries which could be shuffled around easily.</p>
            <h3>Locations & ideas found using:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/" target="_blank">Japan Guide</a>, including sample itineraries.</li>
              <li>Old (the library was throwing it out in 2016!) Fodor's Japan travel guide. The specifics were not up-to-date, but it showed me what to expect in different places.</li>
              <li>Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/" target="_blank">r/JapanTravel</a> for sample itineraries and ideas (I lurked, never posted!). There seems to be a big focus on shopping and eating in social-media-famous restaurants, which we're not very interested in, but it did help with some areas.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.gpsmycity.com/" target="_blank">GPSmyCity</a> for walking tour ideas, user-generated, so some better than others!</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank">Happy Cow</a> to find vegetarian food (we will eat fish / not worry about dashi when eating on the fly, but wanted to plan in some veggie food in advance).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="preparation">
            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-orange">Booking and preparation</h2>
            <p><a href="#travel">Jump to <strong>Travel on Day Zero</strong> section.</a></p>
            <h3>Accommodation</h3>
            <p>I used Booking.com, choosing free cancellation until a few days before. This was both in case Covid screwed us over again, and so that we could change our mind on the specific locations nearer the time.</p>
            <p>I don't cope well with crowds, so in Tokyo chose somewhere a bit further away from the main tourist hotspots, and with a bit more space (table & sofa). I decided that having somewhere calm to retreat to was more important that cutting down travel times. We're close to a metro station anyway!</p>
            <p>Accommodation during the bike tour is arranged for us, including a stay in a Ryokan, so I didn't need to try and sort this out.</p>
            <p>For Kyoto, I worried less about the crowds, as we were planning a few day trips to quieter places and would have just spent a week in the countyside. So I just picked somewhere cheap and close to the main train station.</p>
            <p>Our final night in Tokyo was chosen to be a short train/metro line away from the airport with no changes.</p>

            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <p>Everything seems to open for booking about a month before - deciding what we wanted to do and checking when tickets would go on sale for May was a chore!</p>
            <p>Things I booked / tried to book included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="yes"><strong>Bike tour</strong> with Oka Tours.
              <br><small>I emailed on the off-chance, as they looked full for dates while we were away, but they said they would have room for us! Booked this early, so the rest of the holiday was planned around it.</small></li>
              <li class="no">Free guided tour of <strong>Imperial Palace grounds</strong>: opened 1st April 5am.
              <br><small>I thought it opened 1st May so missed out on tickets.</small></li>
              <li class="yes"><strong>Shizu-Kokoro Chado School</strong>.
              <br><small>No issues booking this for the date & time we wanted - going on Friday 5th May.</small></li>
              <li class="yes"><strong>Sumo tournament</strong>: opened 8th May 10am.
              <br><small>Woke up and logged in for 2am BST, and the site kept crashing as so many people were booking tickets. I got us tickets for May 23rd, but getting up in the night was unnecessary as there were still plenty of cheap seats left a couple of days later!</small></li>
              <li class="yes"><strong>Ghibli Museum</strong>: opened 10th May 10am.
              <br><small>Woke up and logged in for 2am BST, on three computers (one on a VPN pretending to be in Japan). Both the <a href="https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en" target="_blank">international site</a> and the <a href="https://l-tike.com/ghibli/" target="_blank">Japan site</a> (<a href="https://quilt-behavior-fa7.notion.site/How-to-Buy-Ghibli-Museum-Tickets-for-Dec-22-Mar-23-5b5bdeeffe5641378354de3a258d3b49" target="_blank">via VPN</a>) kept crashing, but I finally got tickets at about 5am! The website was terrible; after about 1.5h of refreshing the international site I got put in a queue, but when I reached the end, got redirected to buy tickets for the Ghibli Park (different place) instead! Managed to get tickets via the Japan site for 10am on Monday 8th, and need to pick up the tickets when we arrive, so fingers crossed there are no issues. I have 'backup' international site tickets for 4pm on the same day, so will try to give those away if I have no issues collecting the earlier tickets.</small></li>
              <img class="pure-img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" src=".\images\day00\ghibli-error.png" alt="screenshot of the crashed Ghibli page">
              <li>Lunch at <strong>Tenryu-ji Temple</strong>.
              <br><small>How did this go?</small></li>
              <li><strong>Walking tour of Asakusa</strong> with TokyoLocalized: opens 10-14 days before.
              <br><small>How did this go?</small></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Admin</h3>
            <p>Completed all the entry paperwork on <a href="https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/" target="_blank">Visit Japan</a>, including uploading our Covid vaccine information - this was accepted within minutes. We have QR codes for immigration, customs and Covid procedures, which should speed us through at the airport.</p>
            <p>Chose <a href="https://cellulardata.ubigi.com/" target="_blank">Ubigi</a> for eSIMs (both of our phones allow this). Was a bit of a pain to set up, so I'm glad that we did this in advance. Once set up, you can quickly buy a data SIM - we got a 10GB package each. We'll find out what coverage is like when we get there!</p>
            <p>To help the data last longer, I downloaded Google Maps of the main areas, and Google Translate's Japanese package.</p>
            <p>I made a Google Drive folder to keep all travel documents, tickets, and confirmations in. This, in combination with the Wanderlog itinerary, will hopefully keep us from getting too mixed up while we're there.</p>
            <p>Dates and times for booking various things, reminders for filling in paperwork, cancelling milk deliveries etc all went into my calendar. I tried to spread the admin out over a month or so, rather than do everything all at once.</p>
            <p>We decided against getting a <a href="https://japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html" target="_blank">Japan Rail</a> travel pass, as the bike tour meant we wouldn't be doing enough train trips to make it worth the cost. If not for the tour, it would probably have been worth it.</p>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Both of us took a couple of years Japanese lessons at uni (15 years ago!) but, unsurprisingly, didn't remember much.</p>
            <p>Throughout 2022 we did daily <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, and ramped up how much per day once the Japanese borders officially opened in October.</p>
            <p>I also added the following apps for a few months before going:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mrothberg.kakumei" target="_blank">Kakumei</a> (app for <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank">Wanikani</a>) & <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ringotan" target="_blank">Ringotan</a> to learn basic Kanji.</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://languagedrops.com/" target="_blank">Drops</a> for vocab, focusing on useful travel phrases and food.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How much of this will be helpful while we're there is debatable, but I've been enjoying learning Kanji especially!</p>

            <h3>Packing</h3>
            <p>Our accommodation all have washing machines, so we will just take a few days clothes with us (plus seperate bike clothes for the tour).</p>
            <p>We will take one proper suitcase, one carry-on suitcase, and two carry-on backpacks, with plenty of empty space on the way there so we can fill them with tea to bring home!</p>
