                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Travel on Day Zero</h2>
                <h3>The Plan</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="transport">07:30 bus from home to central Oxford.</li>
                  <li class="no">Buy coffee and breakfast baguettes from the Art Cafe, then head to the next bus stop.</li>
                  <li class="transport">08:30 bus from central Oxford to Heathrow (pre-booked).</li>
                  <li class="yes">Check bags and get through security etc at the airport.</li>
                  <li class="yes">Eat dinner (Japan time) at the airport.</li>
                  <li class="transport">13:20 flight - immediately change time zones on our devices and pretend we're on Japanese time so, a couple of hours after setting off, attempt to get some sleep.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Reality</h3>
                <p>Travel went very smoothly!</p>
                <p>There was lots of traffic heading into Oxford, so we didn't have time to get hot breakfast in town and just grabbed a meal deal sandwich near the bus stop instead.</p>
                <p>The bus arrived at Heathrow earlier than expected, then we got through bag drop and security within half an hour, after a brief encounter with an 'ecobot' cleaning the floor. My cyborg elbow didn't set off the security scanners, which I was actually quite disappointed by!</p>
                <p>We walked around the terminal a couple of times to see what was what, then went to Vagabond for lunch. They had self-pour beers which seemed exciting, but I just got a glass full of foam. This worked out in our favour though as, after some confusion at the bar, we ended up with 1.5 extra free beers with our burgers! So we passed the time very nicely.</p>
                <p>All smooth getting down to the gate, straight onto a bus then onto the plane. No delays and no messing about at all, couldn't have gone better!</p>

              <div id="planning">
                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-orange">Planning the trip</h2>
                <p>I spent months generally flicking through ideas without any real purpose, then proper planning started a couple of months before we went.</p>
                <p>I used <a href="https://wanderlog.com/" target="_blank">Wanderlog</a> to shape the plan. It was great, though it got really laggy once I had hundreds of map pins! You can save locations, then schedule them into daily plans. I threw in everything that I came across, then saw where they were grouped on the map and planned out days from there.</p>
                <p>Then I made lots of sections for e.g. <em>'Tokyo but not slotted in yet'</em>, <em>'tea shops'</em>, <em>'too far away or currently shut'</em>, as well as the daily itineraries which could be shuffled around easily.</p>
                <p>Screenshots from Wanderlog's map will be used a lot in future day reports, to show where we planned to be.</p>
                <h3>Locations & ideas found using:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/" target="_blank">Japan Guide</a>, including sample itineraries.</li>
                  <li>Old (the library was throwing it out in 2016!) Fodor's Japan travel guide. The specifics were not up-to-date, but it showed me the highlights in different areas.</li>
                  <li>Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/" target="_blank">r/JapanTravel</a> for sample itineraries and ideas (I lurked, never posted). There seems to be a big focus on shopping and eating in social-media-famous restaurants, which we're not very interested in, but it did help with some areas.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.gpsmycity.com/" target="_blank">GPSmyCity</a> for walking tour ideas, user-generated, so some better than others!</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank">Happy Cow</a> to find vegetarian food (we will eat fish / not worry about dashi when eating on the fly, but wanted to plan in some veggie food in advance).</li>

              <div id="preparation">
                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-yellow">Booking and preparation</h2>
                <h3>Accommodation</h3>
                <p>I used Booking.com, choosing free cancellation until a few days before. This was both in case Covid screwed us over again, and so that we could change our mind on the specific locations nearer the time.</p>
                <p>I don't cope well with crowds, so in Tokyo chose somewhere a bit further away from the main tourist hotspots, and with a bit more space (table, kitchenette, drawers). I decided that having somewhere calm to retreat to was more important that cutting down travel times. We're close to the metro anyway.</p>
                <p>Accommodation during the bike tour is arranged for us, including a stay in a Ryokan, so I didn't need to try and sort this out.</p>
                <p>For Kyoto, I worried less about the crowds, as we were planning a few day trips to quieter places and would have just spent a week in the countyside. So I just picked somewhere relatively cheap and close to the main train station.</p>
                <p>Our final night in Tokyo was chosen to be a short train/metro line away from the airport with no changes.</p>

                <h3>Activities</h3>
                <p>Everything seems to open for booking about a month before - deciding what we wanted to do and checking when tickets would go on sale for May was a chore!</p>
                <p>Things I booked / tried to book included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Bike tour</strong> with <a href="https://www.okatours.com/" target="_blank">Oka Tours</a>.
                  <br><small>I emailed on the off-chance, in Feb 2023, as they looked full for dates while we were away, but they said they would have room for us! We booked this early, so the rest of the holiday was planned around it. I started to get anxious at the start of April, trusting someone else to plan a whole section of our trip; they sent full details about 3.5 weeks before the start date, so I could see where exactly we'd be staying etc.</small></li>
                  <li class="no">Free guided tour of <strong>Imperial Palace grounds</strong>: opened 1st April 5am.
                  <br><small>I thought it opened 1st May so missed out on <a href="https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/english/about/koukyo.html" target="_blank">tickets</a>, they booked up within a couple of days.</small></li>
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Tea ceremony workshop</strong> with <a href="https://shizukokoro.com/" target="_blank">Shizu-Kokoro Chado School</a>.
                  <br><small>No issues booking this for the date & time we wanted, we are going on Friday 5th May.</small></li>
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Sumo tournament</strong>: opened 8th May 10am.
                  <br><small>Woke up <a href="https://sumo.pia.jp/en/sumo05.jsp#method" target="_blank">and logged in</a> for 2am BST, and the site kept crashing as so many people were booking tickets. I got us tickets for May 23rd, but getting up in the night was unnecessary as there were still plenty of cheap seats left a few days later.<br>Note: I had to use the English site, with a booking fee, as it required a Japanese phone number to sign up for an account on the main Japan site. I knew this beforehand, so wasn't trying to deal with this at 2am!</small></li>
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Ghibli Museum</strong>: opened 10th May 10am.
                  <br><small>Woke up and logged in for 2am BST, on three computers (one on a VPN pretending to be in Japan). Both the <a href="https://l-tike.com/st1/ghibli-en" target="_blank">international site</a> and the <a href="https://l-tike.com/ghibli/" target="_blank">Japan site</a> (<a href="https://quilt-behavior-fa7.notion.site/How-to-Buy-Ghibli-Museum-Tickets-for-Dec-22-Mar-23-5b5bdeeffe5641378354de3a258d3b49" target="_blank">via VPN</a>) kept crashing, but I finally got tickets at about 5am! The website was terrible; after about 1.5h of refreshing the international site I got put in a queue, but when I reached the end, got redirected to buy tickets for the Ghibli Park (different place) instead! Managed to get tickets via the Japan site for 10am on Monday 8th, and need to pick up the tickets when we arrive, so fingers crossed there are no issues. I have 'backup' international site tickets for 4pm on the same day, so will try to give those away if I have no issues collecting the earlier tickets.</small></li>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day00\ghibli-error.png" alt="screenshot of the crashed Ghibli page">
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Cooking & food culture class</strong> with <a href="http://www.kyoto-cooking-class.com/" target="_blank">Haru Cooking</a>.
                  <br><small>I emailed about a month before we'd be in Kyoto to check for availability, and he had space for us on 19th May.</small></li>
                  <li class="yes">Lunch at <strong>Tenryu-ji Temple</strong>.
                  <br><small>I completed their <a href="https://www.tenryuji.com/shigetsu/contact.html" target="_blank">registration form</a> with our requested date about a month in advance. Got a confirmation email the next morning, so we're going on 22nd May.</small></li>
                  <li class="yes"><strong>Walking tour of Asakusa</strong> with <a href="https://www.tokyolocalized.com/asakusa-free-walking-tour-tokyo" target="_blank">TokyoLocalized</a>: opens 10-14 days before.
                  <br><small>There wasn't a tour scheduled 10 days before, so I thought it might not be on (it's Golden Week that week), but I checked again 8 days before and it had been added to the schedule. Very easy to book on.</small></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Admin</h3>
                <p>Completed all the entry paperwork on <a href="https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/" target="_blank">Visit Japan</a>, including uploading our Covid vaccine information - this was accepted within minutes. We have QR codes for immigration, customs and Covid procedures, which should speed us through at the airport.</p>
                <p>Chose <a href="https://cellulardata.ubigi.com/" target="_blank">Ubigi</a> for eSIMs (both of our phones allow this). Was a bit of a pain to set up, so I'm glad that we did this in advance. Once set up, you can quickly buy a data SIM - we got a 10GB package each. We'll find out what coverage is like when we get there!</p>
                <p>To help the data last longer, I downloaded Google Maps of the main areas, and Google Translate's Japanese package.</p>
                <p>I made a Google Drive folder to keep all travel documents, tickets, and confirmations in. This, in combination with the Wanderlog itinerary, will hopefully keep us from getting too mixed up while we're there.</p>
                <p>Dates and times for booking various things, reminders for filling in paperwork, cancelling milk deliveries etc all went into my calendar. I tried to spread the admin out over a month or so, rather than do everything all at once.</p>
                <p>We decided against getting a <a href="https://japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html" target="_blank">Japan Rail</a> travel pass, as the bike tour meant we wouldn't be doing enough train trips to make it worth the cost. If not for the tour, it would probably have been worth it.</p>

                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>Both of us took a couple of years Japanese lessons at uni (15 years ago!) but, unsurprisingly, didn't remember much.</p>
                <p>Throughout 2022 we did daily <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, and ramped up how much per day once the Japanese borders officially opened in October.</p>
                <p>I also added the following apps for a few months before going:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mrothberg.kakumei" target="_blank">Kakumei</a> (app for <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank">Wanikani</a>) & <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ringotan" target="_blank">Ringotan</a> to learn basic Kanji.</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://languagedrops.com/" target="_blank">Drops</a> for vocab, focusing on useful travel phrases and food.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How much of this will be helpful while we're there is debatable, but I've been enjoying learning Kanji especially!</p>

                <h3>Packing</h3>
                <p>Our accommodations have washing machines, so we will just take clothes for a few days with us (plus seperate bike clothes for the tour). We packed for warm weather, as the forecast showed ~25C for our first few days, but will get extra clothes there if we need to.</p>
                <p>Despite attempts to pack light, we ended up with a proper suitcase and a small carry-on backpack each, mostly because our bike helmets took up an annoying amount of space. There is room in the bags for all the tea I plan to bring home!</p>
