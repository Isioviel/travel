                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/nRBj6SL/tour.png" alt="Following a short ride on cycle paths plus a transfer by train, we arrive in Kanazawa in the late morning. Kanazawa has prospered for some 300 years since the feudal lord Maeda Toshiie built a castle here in the late 16th century. The city has not suffered from any war devastation or big natural disaster up to now. Therefore, you can see many winding paths and streets lined with latticed doors and earthen walls, reminiscent of old Japan. We visit the stunning Kenrokuen Garden, one of the three most famous gardens in Japan. The remainder of the afternoon is your free time – enjoy exploring a district of old geisha quarters, former samurai mansions, or the city’s vibrant food market. We stay at a western-style hotel conveniently located in the center city. (Breakfast included)">

                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/6mZp4tk/strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We had a large breakfast again, then set off for a short bike ride along a disused railway cycle path round the coast. It was smooth and flat and very pretty! The cycle path was the most similar to routes we've done in the UK - with overgrown vegetation and constantly stopping at crossings, thankfully no nettles though.</p>
                <p>We arrived at Hakui Station (where I got my first eki stamp of the tour!), left our bikes and main luggage with the vans (they would meet us the next day) and took overnight backpacks on the Thunderbird train to Kanazawa.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/0MpzYhF/path.jpg" alt="coastal cycle path"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/pX0vsrZ/station.jpg" alt="us in front of Kanazawa station"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The train journey was short, and we arrived in Kanazawa with enough time to drop our bags at the hotel before going to a local food court for lunch. We joined a queue for an okonomiyaki restaurant (similar to the griddled pancakes we failed to eat in Tokyo), and ordered ones with shrimp. Inside the restaurant, the chefs are behind a large griddle, and the customers sit behind it; they cook the food in front of you and, once cooked, push it towards you. We were given a knife to cut it into pieces, so you just cut off a small piece at once and rest stays hot on the griddle. It was tasty and very messy - covered in what tasted like BBQ sauce and mayonaise. We only just finished in time to meet the rest of the group.</p>
                <p>We started our walking tour now, first heading through Omicho seafood market. There was a tiny shrine inside with fortunes you could pick from a jar, so I got one (I think it was good...?), then we headed for Kanazawa castle.</p>
                <p>After a short history lesson from Jiru, we walked past the moat into the main grounds. We visited the castle turret, which was a reconstruction of the original castle - inside was some information about the construction methods.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/R74DrM3/castle-outside.jpg" alt="view of Kanazawa castle turret"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/yRJvQgg/castle-inside.jpg" alt="inside Kanazawa castle turret"></div>
                </div>
                <p>After leaving the castle we walked through a big gate, which was an original part of the castle (and I got my fifth stamp of the day, Jiro began looking out for them for me!) and headed towards Kenrokuen Garden, one of the most famous gardens in Japan. Sadly it began to rain, but not too heavily, and it was still warm so we got an ice cream.</p>
                <p>The garden was very pretty - there were a few trees with exposed roots, some lovely ponds and bridges, and various statues as well. We walked up a small hill, past a stone structure that had a sign saying it was a radio tower (we're not sure if we believe it!) to a pagoda with a nice view of a pond. Whilst there, we got distracted by a small pool with coins in, as some of the coins were floating on the top. A few of us took it in turns to try and balance some (1 yen coins are very light) and, after a suggestion by someone that the coins needed to be cleaned of grease from our hands, I cleaned one on my sleave and successfully balanced one. Martin didn't want to get shown up so didn't have a go after that haha.</p>

                </div>
                <p>On the way out of the gardens we passed an ice cream shop, and a matcha shop that also sold ice cream, so everyone stopped to get one! We got one the matcha shop and it was delicious, two tour group members, who had managed to eat ice cream in Asakusa at the shop we didn't queue for, said that this ice cream was just as good, so I don't feel too sad about missing out in Tokyo any more.</p>
                <p>Next, we walked to the Geisha district and visited a historical tea house. These were (and some still are) the homes of the Geishas where they entertained visitors. In one room, a guide from the house showed us some of the musical instruments they would have played and some of us had a go at playing them.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The rain had stopped by now so, though we were offered a taxi back to the hotel, we decided to walk back. Once we were settled I completely ran out of energy so, rather than go somewhere fancy for dinner, we went to a Shogen Burger near the train station. One of the staff members there was collecting poloroid photos of foreign custormers and they had a board out the from with visitors from the US and the rest of the world. He was working on a Europe board, so we decorated a photo for him after eating.</p>
                <p>On our way back, we spotted an Irish pub - we usually accidentally end up in an Irish pub whenever we're on holiday, but hadn't been in one yet in Japan so popped in. We made the mistake of ordering Japanese craft beers though, which obviously weren't ordered much as one of them was very flat and off. Not wanting to deal with language barrier involved in complaining, we just shared the one drinkable beer then quickly left! We headed to a proper craft beer place on our way back for a quick drink, then went back to the hotel.</p>
