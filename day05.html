                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Ghibli Museum</h3>
                <p>We woke up a bit worse for wear after last night and didn't appreciate the early start! We snacked for breakfast then headed to the train, and got to the museum just before 10. We exchanged our paper tickets for another set of tickets, this time little film strips which were really cool!</p>
                <p>Museum itself was very pretty, very well designed with nice stained glass windows and interesting features (no photos allowed inside). We went straight up to the rooftop garden by going up some cute spiral staircases. There was a big robot statue and a little pond or well.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day05\ghibli2.jpg" alt="museum tickets"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day05\ghibli-square.jpg" alt="soot balls"></div>
                </div>
                <p>There was a short film showing, 'Koro's Big Walk', about a dog that gets lost following his owner, and has to make his way home, it was extremely cute.</p>
                <p>We poked our heads into all the corners looking for secrets (found a few sootballs friends), and went into the main exhibition rooms. These were crowded, so it was hard to see everything, but there was a room set up like a writing room / desk, with lots of original drawings and notes on the walls. Another area had moving projections to view, and the temporary exhibition room was about 'Future Boy Conan' which we hadn't seen, so we walked through this area quite quickly.</p>
                <p>I'm glad we went, but we got through it all quite quickly and it wasn't as cute or interesting as I'd hoped.</p>
                <p>We walked back to the station a different way, through the park, and found 'Ochanomizu' spring, which was historically famous for being a good source of water for tea! We also passed a temple where they were burning things outside, and the lake looked like it would have been nice to walk around if we'd had time.</p>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day05\ochanomizu.jpg" alt="ochanomizu spring">
                <p>To recoup some energy before meeting James, we skipped the cream puff shop, bought some soda noodles for lunch (to heat up again, along with some eggs to boil), and headed back to the apartment for a couple of hours rest.</p>
                <h3>Ueno</h3>
                <p>We got the metro to Ueno and, after much walking back and forth (it's a large station!), found the entrance that James was waiting at.</p>
                <p>He took us for a wander around the park, past a big pond with fish and lilypads, a couple of small temples and a shine. For some reason, there was a monument/shrine to glasses by one of the temples! We also found a small flea market (finally!), and I bought a lovely kyusu.</p>
                <p>We wandered through the market area and stopped in an arcade - played a dance game, a train simulator, then a drumming game. It was pretty fun, but we got quite warm doing all the energetic games whilst wearing face masks.</p>

                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day05\ueno.jpg" alt="glasses monument"></div>

                </div>
                <p>We went for sushi for dinner - our first intentional fish of the holiday! James helped us to choose some good stuff, we had tuna, eel, shrimp and tried some of the veggie options as well including Japanese omlette.</p>
                <p>We headed back towards the station, stopping at a little bar for a beer and a whiskey, before saying goodbye to James at 9pm (who had a long train back) and heading back to our apartment for an early night.</p>
