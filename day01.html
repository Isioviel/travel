                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <p>We didn't sleep much on the plane (it was optimistic to think we would!) but closed our eyes and rested for ~7h during Japanese night time anyway with the hope to trick our bodies into adjusting time zones.</p>
                <p>We landed at around 11:20 and we were off the plane and through through immigration/customs/baggage collection within 30 minutes! We got changed in the airport toilets (used our first Japanese toilet!!) before heading out.</p>
                <p>Bought <em>Welcome Suica</em> IC cards for travel, then got the train to Tokyo Station (changing at Shinagawa). The station is a maze! We wandered for a while and failed to find lockers with space, so just kept our bags with us when we went for noodles.</p>
                <p>Vegan ramen at T's Tantan was delicious, then we walked around in circles for a bit looking for my notebook shop (Traveller's Factory). Joined a queue of small children to get my first eki-stamp, admired the outside of the station building, then decided to walk to our apartment.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day01\header0.jpg" alt="meal at T's Tantan"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day01\header1.jpg" alt="trees outside Tokyo station"></div>
                </div>
                <p>To make sure we weren't early to check-in, we walked very leisurely towards the apartment and stopped off at a Lawson to pick up the Ghibli tickets, which was quite amusing. The process went:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Scan my QR code at a machine, which prints out a receipt.</li>
                  <li>Hand the receipt to the cashier, who scans it and prints out another receipt.</li>
                  <li>I sign this receipt, and he gives me another receipt (at this point I assume we're done, and he stops me from walking off without the tickets).</li>
                  <li>He prints out the proper tickets at another machine and hands them over.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>An amusing introduction to Japanese bureaucracy!</p>
                <p>After making it to the apartment we unpacked, worked out how to use the washing machine (it's very quick!), bought some snacks from various convenience stores for breakfast, and picked up Sumo tickets from 7-11 (not as long winded as the Lawson pick-up).</p>
                <p>We headed out for a walk across some bridges to go for dinner, but when we got to Monja Street realised there were long queues for everything. Being too sleepy to cope with standing around, we headed back.</p>
                <p>It was dark by now so the bridges were lit up and everything looked very cool! My phone is pretty terrible at night photography sadly...</p>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day01\header2.jpg" alt="bridges at night">
                <p>We bought cold soba and beer from a convenience store, and ate at the apartment. The food wasn't great, but the beer was welcome!</p>
                <p>Had an early night, and seem to have successfully adjusted to the time zone.</p>
