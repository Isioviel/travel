Our warmup ride starts right out of the airport on a quiet road that gradually descends towards the Noto Peninsula's eastern coast. We then ride along the coast past fishing villages enjoying views of indented bays dotted with small islands. We retreat in a comfortable casual inn that offers a magnificent view of the battle ship-shaped Mitsukejima Island. (Dinner included)">

                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day07\strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We met one of our guides, Atsushi, at T-CAT, and got the bus to Haneda airport. There, we met the rest of the group, most of whom were a bit jetlagged, and got on the plane to Noto.</p>
                <p>It was a short flight, about an hour, but we got some good views from the window! We saw a smoking volcano, lots of gorgeous mountains, maybe saw Fuji out of the opposite side window, and got a good look at the coast we would be cycling along. I was amused by the in-flight drink cups, which were Demon Slayer branded.</p>

                  <source src=".\images\day07\volcano.mp4" type="video/mp4">View of a smoking volcano from the plane window</video>
                <p>When we got off the plane we got changed in the airport toilets, then went out to meet the rest of the guides, Akira, Taku, and Jiru, and set up our bikes. I had brought my own saddle, which they fitted for me, another members of the group had brought saddles and pedals as well.</p>
                <p>It didn't take too long to get set up, and our luggage went into two vans. Two of our guides drove the vans, and the other two cycled at the front and back of the group.</p>
                <p>The first day felt pretty hardcore - we didn't really know what to expect, so everyone was pushing it a bit I think. We made quick time, pushed up a 'big' hill in the heat, and didn't get chance to stop for photographs. We passed lots of little rice paddies and pretty tiled houses on our way towards the coast. It definitely wasn't mostly downhill!</p>
                <p>My saddle post sunk a couple of times, I needed to get that sorted, and other people had various issues too, so we stopped quite regularly at first to sort things out.</p>
                <p>Our first stop, about 20km in, was at a Family Mart convenience store to buy lunch - they turned out to have a much better veggie selection than what we'd found in Tokyo! We got some inari sushi and veg sushi rolls, along with some pastry treats and a big carton of tea.</p>
                <p>We cycled for another 5km until we reached a 'pocket park', where we sat on a ledge looking at the sea to eat our lunch with a fantastic view.</p>

                  <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day07\morning0.jpg" alt="use with bikes at the start of the tour"></div>

                </div>
                <p>Our next rest stop was just another 5km away, at Tsukumo bay's giant squid statue. We got some amusing photos and stretched out on the grass.</p>
                <p>Another 10km of cycling, then we took a longer break on Koiji beach which was beautiful. There was a small island just offshore, with a torii gate next to it, and round the corner of the beach was a bell and a modern heart-shaped artwork telling a tragic love story from 700 years ago involving the island.</p>

                </div>
                <p>There was a very short last cycle to the tip of the peninsular, with a view of Mitsukejima Island. We stopped for a look at the island, and there was a small shrine there too which had fortunes in an egg dispenser (I of course got one - Google Translate struggle to interpret it, and our guide Jiru was very non-commital when asked if it was a good one, so I assume not!). Our hotel was just round the corner.</p>
                <p>There had been an earthquake in the area a few days before, and the epicentre was very close to where we'd be staying the night. We didn't notice any damage on the way in though.</p>
                <p>We checked into the hotel, which was Japanese style but had regular beds (not futons). We didn't have a shower in our room, but there was an onsen (public hot-spring bath), so we went there before dinner. We felt an aftershock from the earthquake as well, it felt like a train going past.</p>
                <p>We were on the ground floor and could walk right out to the sea so, before going to the baths, we walked out to the beach thinking about going for a swim. It was a lot colder than it looked though, so we came straight back in! We did spot someone swimming by the island though, they were much braver than us.</p>
                <p>The hotel provided us with yukatas to wear during our stay, so we put those on and went to the baths with our towels in a bag. The baths are public, and seperated by gender - it was a bit awkward this first time! There were three main rooms, the first one is where you strip off and put your things in a basket. The second room is to clean yourself - there were taps and showers, soap and shampoo etc - so you get fully clean and rinsed off. Finally you can go into the onsen itself.</p>
                <p>For the evening, the ladies side of the baths had an indoor and an outdoor bath, as well as a sauna. The men just had an indoor bath, but they would switch the two sides over in the morning.</p>
                <p>I prefered the outdoor bath as the breeze was nice. It probably had a nice view of the bay if you stood up, but I was too embarassed to do that as I was sharing the space with one of the other ladies from the tour. We had a brief chat, and agreed that we'd be wearing our yukatas to dinner. Once she left, I had the outdoor bath to myself for a bit, and some other people from the tour came to use the indoor one.</p>
                <p>The soaking was nice on my muscles, and it was fun to see all the various moisturiers and hair products available once I got out - I hadn't taken my phone down with me though, so couldn't translate most of them.</p>
                <p>After the bath, we put our yukatas back on and headed over to dinner. Martin and I were the only ones wearing them though, everyone else had chickened out! One of the guides, Akira, was wearing his though, as was everyone else in the restaurant, and Akira let us know about the secret pockets hidden inside that we could put our phones in.</p>
                <p>Dinner was interesting - our first experience of a full Japanese kaiseki-style meal. We had lots of odd looking seafood, various types of seaweed, sashimi, 'shabu-shabu' with fish, various vegetables and mushrooms and, of course, rice and miso soup. All washed down with hojicha tea. The rice came from Senmaida rice paddies, which we would be visiting the next day.</p>

                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day07\evening2.jpg" alt="dinner"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Our group had various dietary requirements - lots of us didn't eat meat, some didn't eat raw fish, one had Coeliac disease - and the tour leader did an amazing job of sorting it all out! We could have been fully veggie without problems, though our dinner would likely have been very boring. As I left, Jiru ran after me to let me know that my yukata was tied the wrong way round (left over right instead of right over left - this way round is how bodies are wrapped for funerals!). I had known about this, and had looked up the correct way beforehand, but still managed to do it wrong multiple times over the next week!</p>
                <p>On our way back to our room we collected a branded cycling jersey to wear during the tour, then we had more tea in our room and an early night. There was another aftershock about half ten, but I didn't notice it as I had gone straight to sleep, it had been a tiring day.</p>
