                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Lazy morning</h3>
                <p>After a long day yesterday, we decided to have a lie-in and skip the market. We ate leftover convenience store snacks for breakfast and Martin booked us in for lunch at a fancy vegan place, Ain Soph, then we set off walking towards the Imperial Palace Gardens.</p>
                <p>We were on a deadline to get to lunch, and also decided to stop for coffee and cake on the way, so by the time we got to the gardens it was getting a bit late. There was a queue to get in as they were checking bags so, rather than rush, we decided to come back later.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/YPBCg9V/roads.jpg" alt="tokyo city roads"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/zNs0W5L/moat.jpg" alt="Imperial Palace moat, building, and tree"></div>
                </div>
                <p>We walked around the edge of the Palace walls and the moat, which was very pretty, and headed towards lunch via a tea shop, Ippodo, and the Kabuki Theatre. Some of the roads were closed to traffic for the day, so the wide roads were filled with pedestrians.</p>
                <p>I got some nice tea from Ippodo, and Martin stayed outside to listen to a classical band playing in the street. We investigated the one-act tickets to the Kabuki, which are no longer available (a casualty of Covid!), and decided not to get tickets for a full performance.</p>
                <p>Lunch at Ain Soph was lovely. We both got a bento box which had lots of vegetables, some karaage made from soy, a tofu 'omlette' and tomato soup. A had plum wine to go with it and Martin got a 'matcha beer' (which turned out to be beer mixed with matcha, not beer brewed with matcha), both of which were fine but nothing special. The food made up for it though, absolutely delicious! I also bought a matcha tiramasu dessert to take home for later.</p>
                <h3>Lazy afternoon</h3>
                <p>We walked back towards the Palace Gardens, and the weather was extremely hot by now. In an attempt to cool down, we took a shortcut across some parks which had very cool trees. Trees in Japan seem generally very nice, like large bonsais. I do not know if bonsais are grown to look like these trees, or if they train the big trees in the same way as they do bonsais.</p>
                <p>We finally made it into the gardens, and spent a couple of hours wandering around. Near the entrance there were old guardhouses and stone walls.</p>
                <p>We walked past some tea plants, which I was very excited to see, and also admired the many varieties of bamboo and the fruit trees. We didn't bother with the audio guide as we were feeling too lazy in the heat!</p>
                <p>We spent a while watching carp in a pond, then headed over to what I thought was a castle ruin, but turned out to be an unfinished castle. The stone walls were cool, and you could walk up to the top and get a nice view of the surrounding gardens.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Tired and too hot, we headed back to the apartment. We took a metro part of the way to stay out of the sun, and bought dinner from a convenience store.</p>
                <p>We spent the rest of the afternoon and evening lounging around in the apartment - heating up some soba noodles (much tastier than eating cold), drinking the genmaicha I bought in Asakusa with some convenience store mochi, and trying on my yukata.</p>
