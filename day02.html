                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Exploring Asakusa</h3>
                <p>We slept well, and ate rice balls and sweet treats from the convenience store for breakfast. We didn't have time to get coffee, so went straight to the metro station.</p>
                <p>It was crowded in the stations (everyone was trying to get to the same place!), so we were 5 minutes late for the walking tour, but they hadn't started yet.</p>
                <p>We met at Kaminarimon gate, then walked up Nakamise street towards the temple - it was super busy!</p>
                <p>We got our fortunes, which involved shaking a silver tower then tipping it so that a stick came out. The stick had a number, which we matched to a drawer containing the fortunes.</p>
                <p>I got 'The Best Fortune', Martin got 'The Good Fortune', so that started the day off well! If you get a bad fortune, you tie it to a rack to leave the bad luck at the temple.</p>
                
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\sensoji0.jpg" alt="lantern at the gate"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\sensoji1.jpg" alt="shopping street"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\sensoji2.jpg" alt="fortune drawer"></div>
                </div>
                <p>We got a free sample cup of cold tea from a stand, then walked past rows of white lanterns, which were advertisements for sponsors of a festival that is happening in a couple of weeks.</p>
                <p>On the main walk into the temple, we 'purified' ourselves by walking through incense smoke and washing our hands and mouth at a fountain. It was very crowded inside the temple, so we didn't manage to get a good look.</p>
                <p>Next to the temple, is a Shinto shrine, and there was a small show with a monkey happening on the grounds. We also saw a collection of portable shines, which were there in preparation for the festival.</p>
                <p>Today was 'Children's Day', a national holiday (which was partly why the area was so busy), and there was a parade happening as we left the shrine. We couldn't get a good look, but there were kids in floats heading around and into the temple.</p>
                <p>After leaving the temple, we walked through some of the local area (getting even busier as time went on), and the tour ended with a view of the Asahi building & Skytree. It was a cool view.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\sensoji3.jpg" alt="white lanterns"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\skyline.jpg" alt="view of Skytree and Asahi building"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The tour now over, we went for lunch at Injoy, a vegetarian restaurant nearby. It was on a middle floor of a small building, so we needed to get in a lift to reach it. There weren't many people in there, and the food was tasty, we had noodles again.</p>                
                <p>It was a really hot day, so we pushed back into the crowds of Nakamise street so I could buy a fan (with rabbits on it!), then headed to the ice cream shop. They had an enormous queue, so we got a drink from a vending machine instead and slowly meandered towards the Shizo-Kokoro Chado School.</p>
                <h3>Tea Ceremony Workshop</h3>
                <p>This was really great. It was just us and another couple from Denmark who were at the end of their trip to Japan.</p>
                <p>We were given sakuracha (cherry blossom tea) to drink when we arrived, and then watched a quick video about the origins of chado (tea ceremony).</p>
                <p>We took off our shoes to go upstairs to the tea room, and sat on the floor. There was a scroll on the wall with a zen saying (possibly <em>ichi-go ichi-e</em>, 'one time one meeting' / 'newness in every encounter'), and the ceremony equipment at the front.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\ceremony0.jpg" alt="sakuracha"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\ceremony1.jpg" alt="zen scroll"></div>
                </div>
                <p>We ate our first sweets of day, and she told us a bit about the teaware (it is purposefully plainly coloured, to not distract from the ceremony), how the ceremony would work, when to bow, what to do when we are given our cup, how to compliment the host... then performed the ceremony for us. It was very precise and delicate, really lovely.</p>
                <p>I got the first cup; it was placed in front of me and we bowed, then I picked it up with my right hand, placed it on my left palm, rotated the cup two quarter turns to face the 'best part of the cup' towards the host (this could be a different coloured section, or visable kintsugi), bowed again and then drank.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\ceremony4.jpg" alt="sweet shaped as a rose"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day02\ceremony5.jpg" alt="me drinking tea"></div>
                </div>
                <p>It was very thick, hard to get out of the cup, but quite nice and not bitter.</p>
                <p>She spoke to us a bit more about tea and about the matcha bowls (they were Rakuyaki, from Kyoto), and then we prepared a cup of matcha for each other (thin tea, so more water in the cup). We chose a bowl for each other (these were more decorative ones, for a less formal ceremony), then whisked the tea to make it foamy.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Wandering and beer</h3>
                <p>We walked back past the ice cream shop, but they were not taking any new orders (the earlier queuing people had got a number to know when to come back). We instead found a little tea shop called Masudaen near the train station, where I bought some genmaicha and shincha (we have come to Japan at the right time to buy very fresh tea!), and we got less-fancy matcha ice creams from there.</p>
                <p>Next, we went next to the secondhand yukata shop, which had some very cheap ones on a rack outside. I chose a yellow one with pink flowers on it. They had men's as well, but I couldn't pursuade Martin to get one!</p>
                <p>We decided that it was time to stop for a beer, so found a tiny (standing space only) craft beer shop, Beerzilla, which turned out to be for British beers. We stayed for one drink, and chatted to the people in there (a Brit, an American, and the Russian owner/bar staff) who recommend us some good places to drink nearby and elsewhere in the city. We needed a sit down, so headed over to the Asahi building to visit their craft brew pub. They had a beer made from roasted tea stems, which really tasted like hojicha + beer, I was very impressed!</p>
                <p>It was dinner time by now, and we had managed to spend the whole day in Asakusa, but we headed over to Akihabara anyway as it was in the direction of home. We went to Ome Farm Shop for vegetarian food, briefly explored some shops, then went to Game Bar Button A for a final drink and some games. Was a lot of fun.</p>
