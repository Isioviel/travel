                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day08\tour.png" alt="We continue along the Noto Peninsula's coastline. In the morning, we head towards Cape Rokugozaki, which is the tip of the peninsula. On the cliff sticking out over the sea, we can enjoy a 180-degree grand panoramic view from Sado Island to Tateyama Alps on clear days. Before arriving at our inn, we pass by Senmaida (one thousand terraced rice paddies). Many layers of tiny rice paddies on the steep slopes offer a unique scene. Today we stay at an elegant Japanese-style inn (ryokan) with a natural hot spring bath (onsen). You can soak yourself in hot spring water and relax â€“ a great way to end a day of bicycling. (Breakfast and dinner included)">

                  <li class="yes">70km cycle, mostly flat.</li>

                  <li class="no">The Ryokan also has a Karaoke room!</li>

                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day08\strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We woke up early, so went back to the onsen before breakfast - they had switched the rooms around, so we could try the other baths. I had the place to myself and their was no condensation on the windows (and my glasses stayed clear somehow), so I had an amazing view of the battleship island and the sea.</p>
                <p>Breakfast was very filling - lots of courses again (though less than dinner), again with plenty of tea to wash it down.</p>
                <p>We set off for a long day of cycling, which was almost even longer - some of the roads had been blocked because of the earthquake, so we almost had to detour an extra 12km up and down a big hill, but thankfully the roads had opened again.</p>
                <p>We noticed a lot more earthquake damage today, lots of damaged buildings including one that had completely collapsed onto a car. There were lots of people actively fixing some of the damage.</p>
                <p>Our first stop today, about 23km in, was at Rokkosaki Lighthouse, we left the bikes in a car park and walked up a hill to visit it, where we got another great view of the sea.</p>
                <p>We then cycled another 6km uphill to lunch at a small restaurant (we had pre-ordered lunch the evening before) with incredible food. We had fish, covered in an amazing sweet sticky sauce, on rice, along with soup and extras. The owner was an artist, and the drinks menu was written on pebbles, and there were lots of interesting objects around.</p>
                <p>After lunch, we cycled another 20km to Tokikunike house, a historical residence with interesting displays.</p>
                <p>8km later, after cycling past lots of rice paddies, we arrived at Senmaida rice paddies - an amazing series of tiny paddies on the side of a hill leading down to the sea. We bought ice creams and, after a warning that birds might try to steal them, enjoyed the view.</p>
                <p>We had just 11km left to get to the hotel, but we managed to loose the guide and get lost. Luckily we knew the address of the hotel, so started following Google Maps, which took us through the centre of the town. We came across two other members of the tour going the other, who had also get lost, so they joined us as we took random side roads. Tacu (one of the guides) found us, after going round in circles for a while looking for us, and we all made it safely to our destination - we should have followed a coastal path, which I'm sure would have been much nicer!</p>
                <p>We got given some tea and sweets in reception which we waited for the remainder of the group to arrive, then checked into our rooms. This hotel had futons, so the room had a table in the middle when we arrived, which staff would move during dinner to put our or futons.</p>
                <p>We visited the onsen again before dinner, it was smaller this time and the showers & soap were around the edges of the bath instead of in a seperate room. I had the place to myself most of the time and stayed in too long so was almost late for dinner.</p>
                <p>Food was lovely again, and similar to the night before. We ordered a beer with our meal this time, along with some local sake, figuring that we deserved it after cycling 75km! More of the group, but not everyone, wore their yukatas to dinner this time.</p>
                <p>After dinner we wandered around a bit and tried to find the karaoke room (it was closed). Our group were the only people in the hotel as everyone else had cancelled because of the earthquake.</p>
                <p>We tested out our futons and buckwheat pillows, which were really comfy, and quickly fell asleep.</p>
