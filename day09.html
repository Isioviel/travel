Wajima is renowned as a center of traditional lacquerware with a history of more than 1000 years. We stop by a local workshop and paint our lacquerware using a traditional painting technique called 'makie.' In the afternoon, we ride along the coast of Notokongo amid rugged scenery created by a cliff and fierce waves. We stay at a Japanese-style hot spring resort hotel. (Breakfast and dinner included)">

                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/M9rjRwR/strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We went straight down to breakfast after waking up - it's great having the yukatas as you don't need to get dressed properly! Breakfast was similar again, very filling.</p>
                <p>We briefly cycled around the town to get to Wajima morning market for a lacquerware painting (makie) class. We picked a plate each with the outline of a design on it - I chose bamboo and Martin chose flowers (sadly all the bunny designs were taken by the time we got to pick!). The class leader showed us what to do, with Akira translating, and said that even small children could do it.</p>
                <p>We each had a pot of liquid lacquer and some thin brushes, and we shared pots of glittery colours to put on top - we painted our design using the liquid lacquer, then deposited the glitter next to it and lightly dusted it over the wet lacquer with a fluffy brush. Martin was very accurate and made a lovely multi-toned design. I attempted to make each bamboo leaf a different colour, but was a bit heavyhanded with the brush so the colours got a bit muddy. They both look pretty cool though!</p>
                <p>After we'd finished painting, we left our plates behind to be set and packed up, and went to explore the morning market. I wanted to find a lacquerware tea caddy with a rabbit on it, but had no luck (found a cat though!). All the shopkeepers were very friendly and, if they didn't speak English, used Google translate to let us know we could pick things up and ask questions. We were nearly late to meet the rest of the group as the owner of the last shop we went into spoke some English and was keen to tell us all about his products and ask us about the UK!</p>
                <p>We began the day's cycling now, heading slightly inland, 19km before lunch. We were supposed to stop for lunch at a local restaurant, by a temple, but they hadn't managed to make enough of the right kind of food (for our various dietary requirements probably) that day, so we kept going and bought food from a Family Mart again. We stocked up on a variety of treats, getting more inari sushi and lots of snacks. It was another 8km before we reached the rest stop to eat our lunch, so we were pretty hungry by then!</p>

                </div>
                <p>After lunch we followed the coast again, briefly stopping at 'Totoro rock' for a picture. This was a regular rock that was sort of the shape of Totoro, so eyes had been stuck on it! It was cute, but we were the only people on the tour to know what it was, possibly the guides had stopped specifically for us as they knew we'd been to the Ghibli museum earlier in our trip!</p>
                <p>Not long afterwards, we were met by the wife and a friend of Tacu, who had brought a drone to take some videos. The filmed us both with a camera from the back of a car, and with the drone, so we look forward to seeing the footage!</p>
                <p>We had one final stop at another (more impressive) rock formation, two large rocks with a shrine rope between them, and a teeny altar balanced on top of one of them.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The final cycle to the hotel was inland and uphill, which felt very hard work as it was the end of the day! We passed a disused nuclear power station on the way.</p>
                <p>Our hotel that night was big and had lots of facilities - including an arcade room with karaoke booths! We got to pick our own yukatas from a selection of colours this time and, after using the onsen and having another large dinner, we headed down to investigate the karaoke. We were tired from a long day, but knew that we had a short ride tomorrow, so had a couple of beers and powered through!</p>
                <p>The karaoke booth was very fun - it used the same system as at the bar in Shinjuku, so we got set up very quickly. Martin attempted to get the disco ball to work but had no luck! We did a few songs but then, halfway through 'Through the Fire and the Flames' by Dragonforce, a hotel staff member opened the door and made it clear we should stop by making a determined X with his arms! We are pretty sure the room was (or should have been!) soundproof, and the room was open when we arrived, so are not sure what the issue was - it was only half 9 in the evening! We turned everything off and left though, and finished our beers in the foyer with two of our tour group who were relaxing there too.</p>
