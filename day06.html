                <p>No plans, so we can go back to anywhere we enjoyed or skipped out earlier in the week, or pick somewhere from the 'extras' list.</p>
                <p>Our main goals for today are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="yes">Have a lie-in.</li>
                  <li class="yes">Do laundry.</li>
                  <li class="yes">Pack suitcases.</li>
                  <li class="no"><strong>Don't walk too much</strong> so we can rest up before the bike tour tomorrow.</li>
                  <li class="no"><em>Maybe <strong>Kabuki</strong> theatre in the late afternoon.</em></li>

                <h3>Title</h3>
                <p>We had a lazy morning then walked to 'Eggs n Things' for breakfast, which was a bit rubbish. We did some shopping afterwards - visited Uniqlo (got underwear for Martin and looked for kids stuff for gifts, but didn't find anything cute), Uogashi Meicha tea shop for more tea to bring home, Bic Camera to get a Nintendo Switch (which we thought included a code to buy Zelda when it came out, but it did not - it is a cool Zelda themed Switch though!).</p>
                <p>Went to the Nitelle Tower to see the Ghibli clock, which moved at 3pm - it was cool to watch (more sootballs!).</p>
                <p>We went home to pack, ready for the bike tour tomorrow, and tested out the teapot I bought yesterday with some genmaicha. We also stopped by Kilpikonna Donuts, a shop we kept walking past with a cute sign outside saying 'donuts and cheer!'.</p>
                <p>We had dinner at CoCo Ichibana, a fast food chain serving Japanese curry with a veggie option. It was okay, nothing too exciting, but was quick. I tripped on the way out and nearly twisted my ankle, thankfully didn't do any proper damage, or I'd had been very stuck for the cycling!</p>
                <p>We had passed a German pub on the way, and decided to investigate it on the way back. We didn't really plan to go in but, whilst looking at them on Google maps, realised that we (stood outside) were making them show up as 'busier than normal' when there were only two people inside. So feeling a bit, we went in for a drink.</p>
                <p>I practiced some Japanese on them, and they were very friendly. Too friendly it turned out, when they kindly brought us a free appitiser of some liver paste on bread to go with our beers. The chef shouted 'enjoy!' with a big grin, so we felt too guilty not to eat it! Our first intentional meat eating in years!</p>
