                <h3>Arrival</h3>
                <p>Our first challenge involved getting to Reading from Oxford and London, as train strikes gave us both fewer options.</p>
                <p>There were no trains running from Radley, so I had planned to get the River Rapids bus, but realised at the last minute that there were some trains running from Oxford station which would mean a much quicker journey. Martin kindly dropped me off there instead of the bus stop and I got there with half an hour to kill, had plenty of time for a coffee.</p>
                <p>Laura's only option was the Elizabeth Line, which got her into Reading about 20 minutes after me. On her way across London, she prioritised shopping for lost/forgotten items (including hay fever stuff for me, thanks!) rather than coffee so, while I waited at Reading, I got one to be cooling down for her.</p>
                <p>Both happily caffinated, we left the station, walking past Reading Museum and through Forbury Gardens - heading for St James Church, the official starting point of the walk. We somehow got stuck in the Gardens (line of sight isn't always the best path) - not a great start as far as navigation is concerned!</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>I had contacted St James Church a couple of weeks before to ask if someone would be there around 10am to stamp our pilgrim passports. I had been told to knock on the door of the presbytery next door and the priest would greet us if he was available but that they couldn't guarantee it.</p>
                <p>In no real rush, we stopped to read some historical information boards in both the Gardens and outside the church, and so reached the entrance at 10:40 to be met by Diago (not the priest) who, unbeknownst to us, had been waiting for us to show us around the church! He didn't seem to mind that we were late (we definitely would have dawdled less had we known!) but I still felt bad.</p>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/6yxskkB/St-James-Church-History.jpg" alt="photo of the historical information board outside St James Church">
                <p>He asked whether we were Catholic (neither of us is), so that he knew what terminology might need clarification, and gave us a tour of the church and discussed some of its history. It was built in the 1800s next to the Reading Abbey ruins - the Abbey was dedicated to St James and supposedly kept a relic of his hand, hence it being a sensible starting location for the modern St James' Way in the UK.</p>
                <p>Diago's explanation as to the many similar relics all over Europe is that throughout history monks would make copies of relics to hide them, and records had been lost as to where the 'originals' were. Nobody knows what <a href="https://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/blog/blood-and-bones-veneration-relics-reading-abbey" target="_blank">happened to Reading Abbey's hand of St James</a> after the dissolution of the Abbey, but a hand was found in the ruins in the 1700s which is assumed to be the one.</p>
                <p>Inside the church is a font built using part of the old Abbey, some interesting stained glass windows with various crests, and some modern artwork about the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela around a statue of St James.</p>
                <p>After showing us the public section of the church, he took us into the back to show us some photographs of the church when it was originally built, and some maps of the area which had close-ups of some of the crests contained in the stained glass. He kindly took them off the wall so that we could take a closer look, and we spent a while inspecting the crests.</p>
                <p>Before leaving, Diago stamped our passports and wished us a good journey. On the way our, we briefly saw the church's priest, who wished us 'buen camino'. We very much appreciated the warm welcome at St James Church, it was a lovely start to our Camino!</p>
                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/wBxR5hK/Starting-Selfie.jpg" alt="us outside St James Church, by the Camino start point sign">
                <p>After an official starting selfie, we walked back over to Reading Museum to get a second stamp for our passports - this time we stamped our own in the reception of the museum, I'm glad we went to the church for our first one!</p>
                <p>Retracing our steps, we walked through the Abbey ruins and properly began our walk along the St James Way.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Detour around the flooded Kennet tow path</h3>
                  <p>We followed the Camino arrows through Reading centre, then joined the tow path on the River Kennet. We were followed by a friendly dog for a while, and spotted (what we think was) a cormorant on the river.</p>
                  <p>It wasn't long before we reached the first flood of the day - a big puddle that didn't seem too bad...</p>
                  <p>We had the option of crossing it, or backtracking the entire way. As the next exit from the river was just past the puddle, we decided to go for it. Laura trusted her waterproof shoes and walked straight through, but it has been a while since I'd re-waterproofed mine and I didn't want to get wet socks so early into the walk! So I took them off and went through barefoot.</p>
                  <p>We tried to keep going, but very quickly the tow path became impassable, so we were forced to turn back and exit onto the road.</p>
                  <p>We follwed an A-road for a while, and joined the river as soon as we had the chance. Looking back down the tow path that we had skipped, we could see that it was completely flooded, but it looked okay going ahead, so we set off with hope in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>It was briefly a very pleasant walk! We passed a lock, the sun came out, and the river was very pretty.</p>
                  <p>We reached a crossroads, where there were signs warning of floods ahead. We had the option to join the road, taking the long way round to our scheduled lunch spot, or to ignore the signs and keep going along the tow path. Emboldened by the previous good stretch, we decided to ignore the signs (they had been there for more than a month, it couldn't still be flooded, right...?).</p>
                  <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/k69K09Q/Tow-Path-Closed.jpg" alt="TOWPATH CLOSED AHEAD">
                  <p>All seemed well for about 1km, then we hit the start of the flooding. We jumped past a bit of it, but it began to get worse and worse. Laura walked ahead through some wet patches to check round a bend - further ahead, the river was properly flowing over the path and it looked very dangerous.</p>
                  <div class="pure-g">
                    <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/rHsZtZq/TowPath3.jpg" alt="Me jumping past some flooding"></div>

                  </div>
                  <p>It has been a fun diversion, but we sadly now had to turn back to the crossroads and take the long way round to the pub. This added 6.5km to our journey and delayed our lunch stop by a couple of hours.</p>
                  <p><em><sup>Note: I realised a few days after this trip, that there is a <a href="https://www.csj.org.uk/st-james-way-latest-news" target="_blank">Latest News</a> page about the Way, which would have warned us about the flooded tow path had I checked it.</sup></em></p>
                  <p>The road wasn't the nicest of journeys, but we passed some weird modern American-looking houses (that must need painting constantly to stay so clean!) and some cute mini lakes in Green Park. We stopped by one of the lakes for a brief rest, realising that we hadn't stuck to the plan of giving our feet a break every hour or so.</p>
                  <p>We finally arrived at The Cunning Man pub at about 14:20 and enjoyed a yummy lunch, a pint, a sit-down, and our third stamp.</p>

                <h3>Pub to pub</h3>
                <p>A couple of weeks before, I had confirmed our visit to St Mary's Church with an expected arrival time of 3pm. Now at least two hours behind schedule, we attempted to call the phone number in the guidebook to ask if we would still be able to visit. After some confusion, we were given the number for Anthony, but decided to wait until our next stopping point before calling again in case we got delayed any further.</p>
                <p><em><sup>Note: since we visited, the guidebook has been updated to include Anthony's contact details.</sup></em></p>
                <p>The official route continued along the tow path, but we had finally learnt our lesson! We chose the shortest road route (this time a similar distance to the river path) to the Fox and Hounds pub.</p>
                <p>We had no major problems this time, apart from getting stuck in some brambles, but we were getting pretty bored of walking along roads instead of seeing lots of river wildlife. It took us about an hour to reach the pub, where we stopped for quick drink and phoned Anthony.</p>
                <p>We apologised for being later than planned, and fully expected him to say that he could no longer meet us, however he was happy to and we told him to expect us in about an hours time.</p>
                <p>Before setting off, we checked our bus options. The original plan had been to end at a pub in Mortimer, where we could relax while we waited for the bus, however we'd walked 6.5km longer than expected. Luckily there was a bus stop not far from the church, and buses were pretty regular - we hadn't really got very far away from Reading!</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Final stretch</h3>
                <p>Next was a short walk around Hosehill Lake, which the guidebook warned could flood after heavy rain... it was absolutely fine though, so we stuck to the planned route - we were finally back on the official St James Way!</p>
                <p>We soon joined a footpath through a wood, with some interesting fungus and lots of mud. It was slow going for a while, but at the top of a very muddy incline, we were met by Anthony, who walked with us the rest of the way to the church - St Mary's is a lovely 13th century church, and being met and given a tour was such a wonderful end to the day.</p>
                <p>We went inside and signed the visitors book - as the 68<sup>th</sup> and 69<sup>th</sup> pilgrims of 2024 (#67 had arrived the day before, also from Oxford!) then were directed to ring the church bell - a tradition that all visiting pilgrims take part in (we were pretty rubbish at it, but it was fun) - before Anthony stamped our pilgrim passports.</p>
                <p>We had time for a quick look around, the church has lots of stained glass windows, including one with St James and some modern designs which were interesting to see. We declined Anthony's offer of being taken to the bus stop - wanting to complete the journey under our own steam - so, as a retired vicar, he blessed our Camino and waved us on our way.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We picked up the pace to the bus stop - thankfully on the official route, so we wouldn't have to backtrack tomorrow - and got there about 30 seconds before the bus, perfect timing!</p>
                <p>It didn't take us long to get back to Reading and our hotel, where we did as the mediaeval pilgrims surely did - sat down, got clean, soaked in the swimming pool and steam room, then ate and drank some tasty wine before getting a good night's rest.</p>

                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/THQBgkz/Day2-Route.png" alt="map screenshot">
                <h3>Planned Stopping Points</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li class="stamped">The Horse and Groom, Mortimer</li>
                  <li class="yes">Silchester Roman Ruins</li>
                  <li class="stamped">St Mary the Virgin Church, Silchester</li>
                  <li class="stamped">St James Church, Bramley</li>
                  <li class="stamped">The Queens College Arms, Pamber End</li>
                  <li class="no">Worting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Return to Burghfield Common</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Woke up a bit stiff, but not too terribly! We re-packed, checked bus options (only one option, as it was a Sunday - 9:35), then headed over the road to get coffee and breakfast snacks.</li>
                  <li>The bus dropped us off a couple of streets away from where we'd got off yesterday, so we headed over to the original stop, then worked out the right way to walk. We were well away from rivers and lakes today, so hoped to stay on the official St James Way this time!</li>
                  <li>The walk to Mortimer turned out to take us less than an hour, and was on country roads and across a few fields. We stopped at a cafe, bought sandwiches to carry for lunch later, and decided to stay put until the Horse & Groom pub opened for the day (at 11am) to get our first stamp.</li>
                  <li>Felt a little guilty not buying anything, but as we'd had drinks in the cafe we didn't want to risk needing the toilet again, as the next pub was hours way!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Muddy walk to Silchester</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Following the official signs, we headed to Silchester, and ended up walking down a very muddy track. Google maps suggested that there was a footpath somewhere else, so we thought we'd gone the wrong way and turned around.</li>
                  <li>We had been going the right way originally, but Google's route looked like it would also be fine, and would take us to the car park at Silchester instead of the the church. As we wanted to have a look around the Roman ruins anyway, we decided to take this route.</li>
                  <li>We walked across lots of fields, following public footpath signs (so we'd definitely end up somewhere!) and despite some mud is was a good walk - there were lots of lambs playing in the fields, a couple were extremely bold and came bounding over to investigate us.</li>
                  <li>Many fields later, we emerged at the car park, to find a toilet and a picnic bench to have lunch at - perfect!</li>
                  <li>After lunch, we ignored a Camino sign pointing a different direction, and walked on the old Roman walls of Silchester. We visited the amphitheatre, and then headed to the church.</li>
                  <li>We were less than half way into the day, and already looking forward to reaching the pub at the end, so only briefly stopped at the church - walking around the outside, and stamping our passports with the stamp left in the porch - before finding the next Camino arrow. We initially took the wrong path (which would have taken us back around the Roman walls), but got there in the end, fighting through some bambles that got very caught in my hair.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Paintings and pub</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A mixture of roads, woodland and fields took us Bramley, where we stopped at St James Church - my favourite church so far!</li>
                  <li>The church was open, and empty, so we went inside to look for the stamp. It wasn't where the guidebook said, but we turned the lights on and dug around, and managed to locate it. Their 'normal' stamp was damaged, so we used their large stamp, which took up a whole page in our passports!</li>
                  <li>In all the excitement of looking for a stamp, it took me a while to notice the medieaval wall paintings, which were absolutely fascinating!</li>
                  <li>They had been uncovered in the 1800s, and dated from the 12th and 13th centuries. There was a large painting of St Christopher, and a really interesting one about the execution of Thomas Beckett.</li>
                  <li>There was one behind the altar that was less well preserved, showing St James.</li>
                  <li>After a short rest in the church, we set off again for the final section of our journey - heading to The Queens College Arms pub.</li>
                  <li>This section was quite narrow, with lots of nettles and brambles. Laura got sliced by barbed wire whilst protecting me from some brambles on the edge of a muddy patch. Between us we had enough first aid supplies to fix her up, but we got luckily, barbed wire is nasty stuff.</li>
                  <li>We passed some deer in a field whilst on a road, then when we started walking through fields ourselves, got so distracted looking at the deer prints in the mud that we almost walked into some boggy patches - it would have been a pretty annoying end to get wet feet so close to the end of the journey!</li>
                  <li>We did manage to stay dry though, and exited the fields for a final short walk along a road to see the pub - a sight for sore eyes.</li>
                  <p>The pub staff were happy to see us, and seemed a bit disappointed when we used the stamp instead of getting them to do it for us - we had got used to the pubs just handing them to us! A very friendly pub, and they still had roast dinner left too. A perfect final stop, right next to the bus stop.</p>
                  <p>Standing back up after eating was hard work, our muscles quickly got very stiff, but we hobbled over to the bus stop and made it to Basingstoke station just in time to miss a train to Reading. We made it home eventually though!</p>
                  <p>A tiring two days, but lots of fun. We'll be back at Pamber End to carry on our pilgrimage in a couple of months!</p>
