                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Train strikes! I had planned to get the bus, but realised last minute that there were some trains running from Oxford station (but not Radley), so Martin dropped me off. Laura got the Elizabeth Line to Reading.</li>
                  <li>I had time to coffee at Oxford station, got to Reading about 20 minutes before Laura, so had time to get here a coffee to cool down.</li>
                  <li>We left the station and walked past Reading Museum, through Forbury Gardens to St James Church. Got slightly stuck in the garden, not a great start as far as navigation was concerned!</li>
                  <li>Stopped to read some historical info boards, so arrived at the church about 10:40. I had contacted them in advance, and was told to knock on the door of the presbytery next door to get our pilgrim passports, but we were met at the door to the church by Diago (?), who let us in and gave us a tour.</li>
                  <li>Build in 1800s; font made from a part of the Abbey; pillar from the Abbey behind the altar; stained glass windows with various crests; modern artwork about the Camino with a statue of St James; photographs of how the church looked when it was built, plus old area maps with closeups of some crests. He then stamped our books and wished us a good journey. We briefly saw with church's priest, who wished us 'buen camino'.</li>
                  <li>Took a photo at the starting location, then walked back over to the museum to collect a second starting stamp - this time we stamped our own books - then walked around the Abbey ruins to properly start the St James Way.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Detour around the flooded Kennet tow path</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Following the Camino arrow signs, we walked through Reading centre then joined the tow path on the River Kennet. Followed by a friendly dog for a while, and spotted a cormarant on the river.</li>
                  <li>It wasn't too long before we reached a big puddle and had the option of crossing it or backtracking into Reading centre - the next exit from the path was just after the puddle. Laura trusted her waterproof shoes, so walked straight through, but I took mine off so as not to get wet socks so early in the walk! After a successful crossing, we walked a few minutes further before realising that the tow path was impassable. We turned back and exited to the road.</li>
                  <li>We followed an A-road for a while, joining the river as soon as we had another option. When we rejoined the path, the way behind (that we had skipped) was flooded, but it looked fine going ahead, so we set off.</li>
                  <li>It was briefly a very pleasant walk. We passed a lock, the sun came out, and the river/canal was very pretty.</li>
                  <li>We reached a crossroads, where there were signs warning of floods ahead - had to option to bail and join the road, or to keep going up the tow path, ignoring the signs. We decided to ignore the signs (which had been there for a month, it couldn't still be flooded, right...?).</li>
                  <li>All seemed well for about 1km, then we hit the start of the flooding. We jumped past a bit of it, but it started to look pretty bad. Laura walked ahead through some wet patches to check - further ahead the river was properly flowing over the path and it looked very dangerous.</li>
                  <li>Sadly, this meant that turning back and walking the long way round to the pub added 6.5km to our journey, and delayed our lunch stop by a couple of hours.</li>
                  <li>Back on the road wasn't the nicest of journeys, but we passed some weird modern American-looking houses (that must need painting constantly to stay so clean!) and some cute mini lakes in Green Park.</li>
                  <li>We finally arrived at The Cunning Man pub at about 14:20 and enjoyed lunch, a pint, and a sit-down!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pub to pub</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>The week before, I had emailed St Mary's Church to ask about visiting the church - I told them that we expected to arrive at 3pm! That was definitely not going to happen, so we attempted to call the phone number in the guide book to ask if we would still be able to visit. We were given the number for Anthony, but decided to wait until our next stopping point before calling again in case we got delayed any further.</li>
                  <li>Deciding not to risk the tow path this time, we found the shortest road route (this time it was a similar distance to the river route thankfully!) to the next stopping point, the Fox and Hounds pub.</li>
                  <li>No major problems this time, but getting pretty board of walking along roads instead of seeing lots of river wildlife, we made it to the next pub about an hour later and stopped for a quick break. We phoned Anthony from here and apologies for being so late - he was happy to meet us though, and knew to expect us in about another hour.</li>
                  <li>Whilst here, we also checked our bus options - the extra 6.5km detour meant that we would not manage to complete the day's planned route to end at Mortimer - luckily they were quite regular, and not too far from the church.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Final stretch</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Next was a short walk around Hosehill Lake, which the guidebook warned could flood after heavy rain... it was absolutely fine though, so we stuck to the planned route - we were finally back on the official St James Way!</li>
                  <li>We soon joined a footpath through a wood, with some interesting fungus and lots of mud. At the top of a muddy incline, we were met by Anthony, who walked us the rest of the way to the church.</li>
                  <li>St Mary's is a lovely 13th century church, and being met and given a tour was such a wonderful end to the day!</li>
                  <li>We signed the book - as the 68th and 69th pilgrims of 2024 (#67 arrived the day before, also from Oxford!) - and rang the church bell, under direction from Anthony, before he stamped our pilgrim passports.</li>
                  <li>The church has lots of stained glass windows, including one with St James, and some modern ones which were interesting to see.</li>
                  <li>We declined Anthony's offer of being taken to the bus stop, wanting to complete the journey under our own steam, so (as a retired vicar) he blessed our Camino and waved us on our way.</li>
                  <li>We picked up the pace to the bus stop - thankfully on the official route, so we wouldn't have to backtrack tomorrow - and got there about 30 seconds before the bus, perfect timing!</li>
                  <li>It didn't take us long to get back to Reading and our hotel, where we did as the mediaeval pilgrims surely did - sat down, got clean, soaked in the swimming pool and steam room, then ate and drink some tasty wine before bed!</li>
                </ul>

                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://i.ibb.co/THQBgkz/Day2-Route.png" alt="map screenshot">
                <h3>Return to Burghfield Common</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Woke up a bit stiff, but not too terribly! We re-packed, checked bus options (only one option, as it was a Sunday - 9:35), then headed over the road to get coffee and breakfast snacks.</li>
                  <li>The bus dropped us off a couple of streets away from where we'd got off yesterday, so we headed over to the original stop, then worked out the right way to walk. We were well away from rivers and lakes today, so hoped to stay on the official St James Way this time!</li>
                  <li>The walk to Mortimer turned out to take us less than an hour, and was on country roads and across a few fields. We stopped at a cafe, bought sandwiches to carry for lunch later, and decided to stay put until the Horse & Groom pub opened for the day (at 11am) to get our first stamp.</li>
                  <li>Felt a little guilty not buying anything, but as we'd had drinks in the cafe we didn't want to risk needing the toilet again, as the next pub was hours way!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Muddy walk to Silchester</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Following the official signs, we headed to Silchester, and ended up walking down a very muddy track. Google maps suggested that there was a footpath somewhere else, so we thought we'd gone the wrong way and turned around.</li>
                  <li>We had been going the right way originally, but Google's route looked like it would also be fine, and would take us to the car park at Silchester instead of the the church. As we wanted to have a look around the Roman ruins anyway, we decided to take this route.</li>
                  <li>We walked across lots of fields, following public footpath signs (so we'd definitely end up somewhere!) and despite some mud is was a good walk - there were lots of lambs playing in the fields, a couple were extremely bold and came bounding over to investigate us.</li>
                  <li>Many fields later, we emerged at the car park, to find a toilet and a picnic bench to have lunch at - perfect!</li>
                  <li>After lunch, we ignored a Camino sign pointing a different direction, and walked on the old Roman walls of Silchester. We visited the amphitheatre, and then headed to the church.</li>
                  <li>We were less than half way into the day, and already looking forward to reaching the pub at the end, so only briefly stopped at the church - walking around the outside, and stamping our passports with the stamp left in the porch - before finding the next Camino arrow. We initially took the wrong path (which would have taken us back around the Roman walls), but got there in the end!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Paintings and pub</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A mixture of roads, woodland and fields took us Bramley, where we stopped at St James Church - my favourite church so far!</li>
                  <li>The church was open, and empty, so we went inside to look for the stamp. It wasn't where the guidebook said, but we turned the lights on and dug around, and managed to locate it. Their 'normal' stamp was damaged, so we used their large stamp, which took up a whole page in our passports!</li>
                  <li>In all the excitement of looking for a stamp, it took me a while to notice the medieaval wall paintings, which were absolutely fascinating!</li>
                  <li>They had been uncovered in the 1800s, and dated from the 12th and 13th centuries. There was a large painting of St Christopher, and a really interesting one about the execution of Thomas Beckett.</li>
                  <li>There was one behind the altar that was less well preserved, showing St James.</li>
                  <li>After a short rest in the church, we set off again for the final section of our journey - heading to The Queens College Arms pub.</li>
                  <li>We passed some deer in a field whilst on a road, then when we started walking through fields ourselves, got so distracted looking at the deer prints in the mud that we almost walked into some boggy patches - it would have been a pretty annoying end to get wet feet so close to the end of the journey!</li>
                  <li>We did manage to stay dry though, and exited the fields for a final short walk along a road to see the pub - a sight for sore eyes.</li>
                  <p>The pub staff were happy to see us, and seemed a bit disappointed when we used the stamp instead of getting them to do it for us - we had got used to the pubs just handing them to us! A very friendly pub, and they still had roast dinner left too. A perfect final stop, right next to the bus stop.</p>
                  <p>Standing back up after eating was hard work, our muscles quickly got very stiff, but we hobbled over to the bus stop and made it to Basingstoke station just in time to miss a train to Reading. We made it home eventually though!</p>
                  <p>A tiring two days, but lots of fun. We'll be back at Pamber End to carry on our pilgrimage in a couple of months!</p>
