                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Shibuya</h3>
                <p>We set off early-ish, in raincoats as it was forcast to rain all day.</p>
                <p>The shrine wasn't very busy (weather? it was a bit drizzly but not too bad yet), and it was a nice walk through a wood, through massive torii gates.</p>
                <p>Wrote a wish for all the kids in the family, got my first goshoin, saw a bride getting photographed, got told off for taking a photo of some sake offerings, as we were near to no photograph sign (but not taking a photo of the stuff I wasn't allowed to photograph!)</p>
                <p>Took the wrong way to the park, so walked through some side streets which was interesting to see, got a hot coffee in a tin from a convenience store (pretty gross), finally made it to the park.</p>
                <p>No flea market (weather?? the website said it should be there) so we just wandered for a bit, then walked down into Shibuya proper.</p>
                <p>Not that interesting... tall buildings and fancy shops, seemed similar to Ginza, but then we reached the crossing which was pretty cool! Masses of people waiting with umbrellas on all sides of the road then crossing at once. We stopped by the billboard at the start of Alice in Borderland, and went to find the dog statue. It was really small and not all that exciting.</p>
                <p>The rain was getting heavier, but I was keen to visit the cemetery, after having seen one from the train as we left the airport and thinking it looked really beautiful. We bought some rice balls and pastries for lunch, and got on the metro to avoid the rain.</p>

                <h3>Cemetery & Harajuku</h3>
                <p>When we reached the edge of the cemetery, we stopped under a tree to quickly eat (rain was getting bad), then walked through the cemetery to the metro on the other side. It was really beautiful!</p>
                <p>Pretty wet now, we got on another metro to Harajuku. Wanting to stop somewhere dry, I directed us to a tea shop which was closed, then to 'The Matcha Tokyo' on Cat Street.</p>
                <p>After this brief stop, which didn't dry us out, we headed to the metro via Takeshita Street.</p>
                <p>We passed a secondhand clothes shop on the way, so popped in to get me a change of clothes (my denim skirt was so heavy with the rain, that it kept unzipping itself!), and also bought umbrellas from a convenience store.</p>
                <p>Takeshita Street was a bit busy, despite the rain, but we didn't see anyone dressed in anything interesting sadly - I'm sure it's much more interesting in better weather!</p>

                <h3>Shinjuku</h3>
                <p>We got of the metro and went straight to a craft beer pub, Yona Yona Beer Works, to dry off for a bit. We ordered a drink and some chips, which tasted like they'd been cooked in chicken broth but ate them anyway.</p>
                <p>Changed and mostly dry, we went back out in the rain to look for the Godzilla head. On our walk, we heard a girl group singing on the side of a building, with a bunch of fans standing around dancing along. We stopped to watch for a bit (we could see the group, and also a big screen showing a close up) which was pretty fun. It was part of the 歌舞伎町UP GATE↑↑ event, and we have no idea who the group were!</p>
                <p>We found Godzilla, then went to Hanazono shine (despite being too late for the flea market) to get my second goshuin - they gave me some tea also!</p>
                <p>Sad and wet, we headed in the direction of Golden Gai to look for an open bar. Went into the metal pub called Gods, and spent a while there drinking Satan Beer and Ryokucha Hai (green tea and shochu).</p>
                <p>Ran across the road to Shogun Burger for veggie burgers, then headed to 'Champion Bar' on the edge of Golden Gai for karaoke. We were some of the first people in there, so got to have a go before it go too busy. A German guy was at the bar when we arrived, we assumed he was a tourist, but then he launched into a Japanese song, turns out he'd lived there for 30 years and is a regular at the bar. A Japanese guy joined him and they took in in turns to sing for a while. We did Paradise by the Dashboard Light!</p>
                <p>The bar filled up, we drank too many beers and sakes, chatted to Greek guy from Belgium and a British couple on their last night in Japan (the bar was mostly filled with foreigners). I tried to give away our spare Ghibli tickets for tomorrow but nobody was interested. There were three Japanese guys at the back who sang 'I Want It That Way' which we all joined in with.</p>
                <p>Had a great night! Didn't go into a 'more proper' Golden Gai bar afterwards as they all looked a bit miserable, so we got the metro back and went to bed.</p>
