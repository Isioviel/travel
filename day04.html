                <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What We Actually Did</h2>
                <h3>Shibuya</h3>
                <p>We set off early-ish to try and avoid crowds, in raincoats as it was forcast to rain all day.</p>
                <p>The shrine wasn't actually very busy (possibly because of the weather, it was a bit drizzly but not too bad yet), and it was a nice walk through a wood, through massive torii gates.</p>
                <p>The shrine itself wasn't as big, or as busy, as I had expected. We got another fortune, this time in the form of a poem and wrote a wish on a wooden board for all the kids in the family.</p>
                <p>We saw a bride getting photographed, then I got told off for taking a photograph of the sake offerings next to the shrine (there was a 'no photographs' sign nearby, but I thought that was for the shrine itself, and I was pointing my camera a different direction) so felt like a very bad tourist. Before leaving, I got my first goshuin stamp.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/QHHzx3R/meiji.jpg" alt="torii gate at the entrance to Meiji Jingu"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/MsjBDXr/goshuin.jpg" alt="goshuin stamp from Meiji Jingu"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Instead of leaving directly to the park, we took a detour to look for cash (for the flea market) and coffee. We walked through some side streets, it was interesting to see the houses and apartments, got cash and a hot coffee in a tin from a convenience store (which was pretty gross) then finally made it to the park.</p>
                <p>After wandering around for a bit in the drizzle, we realised there was no flea market (again possibly the weather, the website said that it should be there) so we headed into Shibuya proper which, it turns out, is not that interesting.</p>
                <p>There are lots of tall buildings and fancy shops, and it seemed similar to Ginza. The massive crossing was pretty cool though, especially as it was raining so there was a sea of umbrellas! Once across, we stopped by the billboard outside the station (from Alice in Borderland, just because there wasn't much else to do), and then went to find the Hachikō statue, which was much smaller than I was expecting.</p>

                <p>The rain was getting heavier, but I was keen to visit the cemetery, after spotting a really beautiful one from the train as we left the airport. We bought some rice balls and pastries for lunch, and got on the metro to avoid the rain.</p>

                <h3>Aoyama Cemetery & Harajuku</h3>
                <p>When we reached the edge of the cemetery, we stopped under a tree to quickly eat (rain was getting bad), then walked through the cemetery to the metro on the other side. It was really beautiful, and much bigger than I realised.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/58CVQwc/dolls.jpg" alt="bamboo and stone dolls near Aoyama Cemetery"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/MNwPgzv/cemetery.jpg" alt="Aoyama Cemetery"></div>
                </div>
                <p>The rain was coming down very heavily now, and our raincoats were not providing much protection, so we jumpted back on the metro to Harajuku and looked for somewhere dry to stop. I firstly directed us to a fancy tea shop which was closed, then to 'The Matcha Tokyo' on Cat Street where we sat for tea and dessert.</p>
                <p>It was a brief stop, so we didn't really dry out, so walked as quickly as we could to Takeshita Street, which was our last planned stop before going to Shinjuku.</p>
                <p>We passed a secondhand clothes shop on the way, so popped in to get me a change of clothes (my denim skirt was so heavy with the rain, that it kept unzipping itself!), and also bought umbrellas from a convenience store.</p>
                <p>Takeshita Street was a bit busy despite the rain (mostly of people queuing for various dessert shops!), but we didn't see anyone dressed in anything interesting sadly - I'm sure it's a much more interesting place in better weather.</p>

                <h3>Shinjuku</h3>
                <p>After a short metro to Shinjuku, we went straight to a craft beer pub, Yona Yona Beer Works, to dry off for a bit. We ordered a drink and some chips (which tasted like they'd been cooked in chicken broth, but ate them anyway), got changed and dried off - they handed us towels when we went in!</p>
                <p>Feeling much happier, we went back out in the rain (armed with umbrellas as well as raincoats now!) to look for the Godzilla head. Before getting very far, we heard a girl group singing on the side of a building, with a bunch of fans standing around dancing along. We stopped to watch for a bit (we could see the group, and also a big screen showing a close up) which was pretty fun. It was part of the <em>歌舞伎町UP GATE↑↑</em> event, but we have no idea who the group were!</p>
                <p>We found Godzilla, then went to Hanazono shine (definitely too late for the flea market) to get my second goshuin - they gave me a small packet of tea with my stamp which was nice.</p>
                <p>Sick of walking around in the rain, we headed in the direction of Golden Gai to look for an open bar. It was too early for most places to be open, but we found a metal pub called Gods and spent a while there drinking Satan Beer and Ryokucha Hai (green tea and shōchū).</p>
                <p>When we got hungry, we ran across the road to Shogun Burger for veggie burgers (tasty), then headed to 'Champion Bar' on the edge of Golden Gai for karaoke. We were some of the first people in there, so got to have a go before it go too busy.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/CzLK1tk/shinjuku.jpg" alt="us in the rain in Shinjuku"></div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/5MZy80s/karaoke.jpg" alt="karaoke machine in Champion Bar"></div>
                </div>
                <p>A German guy was at the bar when we arrived, who we assumed was a tourist until he launched into a Japanese song! He had lived in the area for 30 years and is a regular at the bar along with a Japanese guy who joined him. They took in in turns to sing for a while and then Martin and I sung the traditional <em>Paradise by the Dashboard Light</em>.</p>
                <p>The bar filled up with tourists and we drank too many beers and sakes whilst chatting to a Greek guy from Belgium and a British couple on their last night in Japan; I tried to give away our spare Ghibli tickets for tomorrow but nobody was interested. There were three Japanese guys at the back who sang 'I Want It That Way' which the whole bar joined in with. We had a great evening!</p>
                <p>We didn't go into a 'more proper' Golden Gai bar afterwards as they all looked a bit miserable, so we got the metro back and went to bed. We definitely would have saved money on a day-pass for the metro today, but we didn't know the rain would get so heavy.</p>
