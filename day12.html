                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day12\tour.png" alt="We leave Obama and ride along the quiet coastline of Wakasa Bay, and eventually head inland. After pedaling along a gentle river for a while, we ride over the hill and take a lunch break. Our afternoon ride starts with a relaxing 10km ride on a flat terrain, which gives us enough time to digest our lunch and get ready for a 9km climb. You can ride at your own pace enjoying the fresh air of forests and the sound of water streams. We eventually cycle down Miyama, which consists of clusters of picturesque hamlets with traditional kayabukiyane (thatched roof) farmhouses. Kayabukiyane houses nestled in peaceful mountains are the perfect example of what the Japanese countryside used to look like in the old days. We stay at a Japanese-style inn.

                <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\day12\strava.png" alt="strava route map">
                <p>We set off from Obama after another large breakfast, for our final coastal route before heading inland.</p>
                <p>After our 'warm up climb', which was a big spiralling bridge/road between the hills, we stopped for lunch at a rest stop, which had a couple of restaurants and loads of vending machines. I was pretty exhausted already, and we hadn't started the big hill yet! Some delicious (hot) kitsune soba revived me, we got some treats to help us up the big hill from the vending machines, and wandered over to a thatched roof house nearby.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We cycled for a while to digest before starting the main climb of the day, which is the hardest thing I have ever done!</p>
                <p>I told Martin to go ahead, as I didn't want to hold him up, and he was first up to the top!</p>
                <p>I kept stopping to take breaks for water, and also found a toilet part way up in what must be a holiday area. I was keeping pace with someone else from our group for a while - he was slower than me but didn't ever stop, and I kept stopping for water/photo breaks, so it was nice to have the company.</p>
                <p>About three quarters of the way up I really began to flag, and the van caught up with me. They offered me a lift (one of the other tour group members had already got in), but I declined - I did get my water bottle filled up though which was a relief!</p>
                <p>Our guide, Atsushi, kept me company the rest of the way up, keeping me motivated by telling me the elevation. When I finally made it to the top I was, apparently, only a couple of minutes behind the last person, but Martin had been up there for ages - Tacu came over to congratulate Martin and let me know how strong he was - I was very proud!</p>
                <p>I was a complete wreck for a while, having used up all of my energy. I burst into tears and couldn't stop crying until someone gave me some chocolate!</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-3"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src=".\images\day12\hills0.jpg" alt="waterfall on the way up the mountain"></div>

                </div>
                <p>We now had to decend the mountain, which was also difficult as it was very steep. We didn't have too far to go though until our final destination of Miyama.</p>
                <p>As we arrive, there were lots of tourists just leaving - it's a popular place to visit as it's full of traditional thatched roof houses.</p>
                <p>We were taken to the guesthouse, Hiyasa, which was one of the old houses. The owners lived next door in a more modern house, and would be our hosts for the evening.</p>
                <p>Our room didn't have anywhere to sit down, so we sat in the main living area while our roommates for the night stayed in their rooms as they had chairs. The hosts had provided tea, so we sat and drank that, and one of the other guests ran down to the village shop before it closed and brought back beers for us all which was very kind.</p>
                <p>We used the bath, which was across in the other house. They had a shower room to use, and a filled bathtub with a lid to soak in afterwards. Luckily we all knew the drill by now so knew to clean ourselves before getting into the shared bath!</p>
                <p>While our hosts were preparing dinner, we went for a wander around the village in our yukatas, visiting the tiny shrines and admiring the scenery. An old lady walked with us for a while and kept talking to us in Japanese. We managed to agree which of the two guesthouses we were in, that our 'tomodachi' (friends) were staying in the other one, and that we were on 'jitensha' (bikes) - I was quite pleased with that, our very limited vocabulary came in handy!</p>

                </div>
                <p>Dinner was vegetables and fish that we simmered in a big pot on the table. We were joined by Akira and Jiru for the evening, and it was a great and informal meal. Akira told us a bit about previous and upcoming bike tours (he seemed surprised that the day's ride had been challenging, because we did it much quicker than his last group!) and his time living in the UK.</p>
                <p>We stayed up for a while chatting to the other people staying with us, then went for a well deserved night's sleep on our futons next door.</p>
